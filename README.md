# KnowledgeSpaceApps

These apps were created during an internship at the University of TÃ¼bingen.
They are a part of the "Tools for Teaching Quanitive Thinking" (TquanT) project, which you can visit [here](https://tquant.eu/).
To run them you will need the *shiny* package for R.

Right now there is only the *KS_Relation.R* app, in which you can learn about precedence relations and how a knowledge space can emerge from them.
